# Covid19-Mask-Protection

Repository contains efficient deep leaning model for mask detection

### Models Used

MobilenetV2 trained on imagenet with top custom layers

### Weights
face detector 
trained keras model for mask classification

## Usage

1.Put training images in datase folder with mask and non-mask respectively.                                                                                      2.Run train_mask_detector.py file to refine model or you can train the model 
  from scratch just remove "imagenet" in training images.
